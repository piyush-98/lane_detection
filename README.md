# lane_detection

Lane detection is a well-researched area of computer vision with applications in autonomous vehicles,but despite the
simplicity of finding white markings on a dark road, it can be very difficult to determine lane  markings on various 
types of road. These difficulties  arrive  from  shadows, occlusion by other  vehicles, changes in the road surfaces 
itself, and differing types of lane markings.

A lane detection system  must  be able to pick out all manner of markings from cluttered roadways and filter them to 
produce a reliable estimate of the vehicle position and trajectory relative to the lane.In any driving scenario, lane
lines are an essential component of indicating traffic flow and where a vehicle should drive.
#### Thus the objective of this project is to overcome these challenges and provide driver support systems.
